										Victoria Greene would rather spend her time with machines than the high society

										means she
										will end up a spinster.
										<br>
										<br>
										When her father gets the funding for a trip to the Amazon to search for a
										mythical jewel, she jumps on the chance to come aboard as the Master Tinker. She
										expected to work on the massive boilers for the airship and to tinker with her
										mechanical creatures. She never expected the men suddenly thrown into her life
										making it even more interesting. The inventor, the cowboy, the scholar, and the
										dreamer are all intrigued by the woman who comes with grease on her face.
										<br>
										<br>
										But something sinister is amiss aboard the airship and she's determined to get
										to the bottom of it. Victoria's suspicion rises the closer they get to Brazil
										and she must figure out the nefarious plans before it's too late.
										<br>
										<br>
										Can Victoria protect them all against the dangers, from onboard and the

											knew. When the Queen of England sends Vic and her men on yet another

										Clara spent her whole life fighting in courtrooms for the downtrodden, the
										strange ones, the abused. It’s only natural that when a man with rabbit ears on
										his head comes to see her, she doesn’t blink an eye…
										<br>
										...until he opens a portal and drags her to Wonderland.
										<br>
										<br>
										But this isn’t the world she’s read about at home. This world has been twisted,

										<br>
										<br>
										There’s a prophecy, the only chance Wonderland has of survival. Clara is
										foretold to defeat the Knave and claim the Hatter’s heart. But there’s a
										problem. The Hatter is insane and Wonderland is full of unspeakable horrors.
										Death waits behind every tree. If the Beezles don’t get you, the Bandersnatch
										will.

										Can Clara embrace the madness and her destiny, or will the reign of the Red

										<br>
										<br>
										Kenzie has lived in Whisperwood since she was a child. She’d fallen into a
										strange but happy routine that included her best friend and boyfriend, but when

										<em>
…where the petting zoo gets a little insane.

										Crane has always avoided the living at all costs, his job in the morgue only

										the proper jerk has a fascination with heads. Willingly checking himself into
										Whisperwood should have been the answer to his problems. Instead, the feisty
										blonde with a taste for trouble only seems to make his own yearning for blood
										stronger.
										<br>
										<br>
										When All Hallows Eve crashes down upon Kenzie and Crane, will they be strong
										enough to survive the massacre, or will they remain locked within the

The next matriarch has been chosen. . .

</em>
											<br>
											<br>
											Sage has never wanted anything other than the freedom to live her own life,
											but when she is chosen as the next Matriarch of her people, everything
											changes. Sent on a journey to pass the tests of her ancestors, Sage must
											find her place in this world even though she doesn't know if she believes in
											the very spirits who chose her for the position.
											<br>
											<br>

											As if her life isn't complicated enough, she finds herself on the run with a
											pack of raptor shifters. Sage's newfound allies are dangerous predators but
											the attraction she feels to them is undeniable.
											<br>
											<br>

											With a new threat to the peninsula, Sage has her work cut out for her. No
											one said being the Matriarch would be easy.
											<br>
											<br>

											Can she make it back to her people with her body--and her heart--intact? Can
											she stop the traders who threaten her very way of life?
											<br>
											<br>

											With Kishil, Talon, and Elu at her side, maybe she can . . .

											<em>
65 Million years ago,
<br>
Dinosaurs walked the Earth . . .
</em>

											<br>
											<br>
											People think that a meteor or some super volcano wiped them all out, or that
											aliens saved them like a holy arc coming from the sky. Some think that they
											had their time and were selected for extinction.
											<br>
											The thing is, fossils only show those that died. . .
											<br>
											Dinosaurs still walk among us, hidden in human form, bidding their time
											until they’re able to reveal who they are. Humans are always placed at the
											top of the food chain.

											<em>
Nothing could be further from the truth. . .

											*********************************************************************
											<br>
											<br>
											<em>
Rowena Wickham only wanted one thing: freedom.
</em>
											<br>
											<br>
											But the Wild West is a brutal place filled with dinosaurs and outlaws. With
											no other option, Rowena became one of the very outlaws the West is ran by,
											and she made her own mark in the world.
											<br>
											<br>
											With too many mouths to feed in her crew, the Free Outlaws, Rowena has no
											choice but to hit something big, the place that was rumored to be equal
											between dinosaurs and humans alike, Embertown. She never expected the bank
											owner to be a tyrannosaurus rex. She certainly never expected the same of
											the Sheriff.
											<br>
											<br>
											But Rowena has a bigger problem. Not only is she dangerously attracted to
											the men she plans to rob, but Les ‘The Croc’ Chambers is headed towards
											Embertown, and Ro will do anything to escape his claws.
											<br>
											<br>

											Rowena just has to rob the bank under the clever noses of Sheriff Bennett
											and Virgil King, and skip town before they notice.
											<br>
											<br>
											<em>
Easier said than done.
</em>
											<br>
											<br>

**Rexes & Robbers is a ménage book within the Dinoverse and includes a tough outlaw and some sexy tyrannosaurus rex shifters. If bank robbery isn’t your thing, don’t worry, Ro has you covered. **

												<em>
A deadly disease has spread through the Blooming Courts of Tuatha.
</em>
												<br>
												<br>
The louloudi are meant to flourish for a thousand years before they return to the Earth. Death has been a distant foe for so long, no one spares it any thought. Until now. As sickness sweeps through the kingdom, with the cure always just out of reach, the courts have never been filled with so many blossoms. Even in death, they breathe life.
												<br>
												<br>
Ila Slystina has been raised in the confines of the Orchidasi Kingdom, wanting for nothing, hidden away like some sparkling treasure, but she dreams of so much more. When she’s caught returning from a forbidden trip, her mother, the Queen, punishes her the only way she sees fit.
												<br>
												<br>
Ila is sent on her season far earlier than she should be. Now, she’s being paraded through the twelve courts like a prized cow and she wants nothing more than to escape. But along the way, she just might get more than what she bargained for.
												<br>
												<br>
After all, the courts aren’t the only things that must bloom . . .
